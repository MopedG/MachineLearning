However, he removes 9 flowers from the arrangement.\n\nNow, let's calculate the final number of flowers:\n\nTotal initial flowers = 45 * 8 = 360\nFlowers removed = 9\n\nTo find the final number of flowers, we subtract the number of flowers removed from the total initial flowers:\n\nFinal number of flowers = Total initial flowers - Flowers removed\n= 360 - 9\n= 351\n\nHere is the JSON object with the final answer:\n{\"answer\": 351}",
