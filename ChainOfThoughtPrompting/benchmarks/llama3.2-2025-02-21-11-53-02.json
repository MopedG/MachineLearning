The supermarket sells 35 bottles of juice per day.\n2. One bottle of juice costs $3.\n3. To find the daily revenue, multiply the number of bottles sold per day (35) by the cost of each bottle ($3). \n   Daily revenue = 35 * $3 = $105.\n4. To find the total revenue for a 12-day period, multiply the daily revenue by the number of days (12).\n   Total revenue = $105 * 12 = $1260.\n\nTherefore, the supermarket will make $1260 in a 12-day period.",

To find the total amount of evaporation over 3 weeks, multiply the weekly evaporation by 3:\n\n2,500 liters/week x 3 weeks = 7,500 liters\n\nNow, subtract the total amount of evaporation from the initial capacity of the pool:\n\n10,000 liters - 7,500 liters = 2,500 liters\n\nSo, after 3 weeks, there will be 2,500 liters of water remaining in the swimming pool.",

We want to find out how much water remains after 3 weeks, so we need to calculate the total amount of water evaporated over this period.\n\nStep 3: Multiply the weekly evaporation by the number of weeks\nTo find the total amount of water evaporated in 3 weeks, we multiply the weekly evaporation (2,500 liters) by the number of weeks (3).\nTotal evaporation = 2,500 x 3 = 7,500 liters\n\nStep 4: Subtract the total evaporation from the initial capacity\nNow, we subtract the total amount of water evaporated in 3 weeks (7,500 liters) from the initial capacity of the pool (10,000 liters).\nRemaining water = 10,000 - 7,500 = 2,500 liters\n\nTherefore, after 3 weeks, there are 2,500 liters of water remaining in the swimming pool.",
